# Documentation Template

**Important:** This documentation follows a code-example-free approach. See the "Documentation Strategy" section below.

## Documentation Strategy

### Philosophy
- **No Code Examples:** Documentation does not include code snippets to avoid maintenance overhead
- **Path-Based References:** Always reference the actual file path where functionality is located
- **Usage Guidelines:** Provide clear instructions on what to use and when, without showing implementation
- **Import Instructions:** Specify exact import paths when mentioning functionality

### Benefits
1. **Maintainability:** Documentation stays valid even when implementation changes
2. **Clarity:** Focus on concepts and usage patterns rather than syntax
3. **Scalability:** Easy to keep documentation in sync with codebase
4. **AI-Friendly:** AI agents can follow clear paths and instructions

## Documentation Guidelines for AI Agents

### When Writing Documentation

**DO:**
- Reference exact file paths (e.g., `use function from src/path/to/file.ts`)
- Describe what functions do and their purpose
- Explain parameter types and return values
- Provide usage context and scenarios
- Link to related documentation
- Specify import paths clearly

**DON'T:**
- Include code examples or snippets
- Show implementation details
- Copy large blocks of code
- Create examples that may become outdated
- Duplicate implementation logic

### Documentation Structure

Each documentation file must include:

1. **Overview** - What this module/component does
2. **Location** - Exact file path
3. **Exports/Functions** - List with descriptions
4. **Usage Guidelines** - How to use without code examples
5. **Related Documentation** - Links to related files
6. **AI Agent Instructions** - Clear guidance for AI agents

## AI Agent Instructions

When working with this codebase, AI agents should:

### For Finding Functionality
1. Look for the specific file path mentioned in documentation
2. Read the TypeScript/JavaScript file directly
3. Understand function signatures and types
4. Follow the implementation logic
5. Apply the pattern to your use case

### For Writing New Code
1. Follow existing patterns in the codebase
2. Use types from `src/domain/types/`
3. Implement interfaces from `src/domain/entities/`
4. Import from the correct modules
5. Follow the established architecture

### For Modifying Existing Code
1. Read the complete file before making changes
2. Understand the context and dependencies
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Update type definitions if needed
5. Test thoroughly

---

## Rules and Guidelines

### Documentation Rules

1. **No Code Examples:** Never include code blocks in documentation
2. **Path References:** Always use relative paths from package root
3. **Clear Language:** Use simple, direct instructions
4. **Type Information:** Include TypeScript type information where relevant
5. **Cross-References:** Link to related documentation liberally

### Code Rules for AI Agents

1. **Read First:** Always read existing code before writing new code
2. **Follow Patterns:** Match the style and patterns of existing code
3. **Type Safety:** Maintain TypeScript type safety
4. **Test:** Ensure code is testable and tested
5. **Document:** Update documentation when adding new features

### Prohibited Activities

**For Documentation:**
- ❌ Including code examples
- ❌ Copying implementation into docs
- ❌ Showing full file contents
- ❌ Creating usage examples that duplicate code

**For AI Agents:**
- ❌ Writing code without reading existing implementations
- ❌ Making assumptions about code structure
- ❌ Skipping type definitions
- ❌ Ignoring documentation paths
- ❌ Creating parallel implementations

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When Code Changes
1. Update type definitions if signatures change
2. Update documentation if behavior changes
3. Keep paths accurate
4. Verify cross-references
5. Test imports work correctly

### When Features Added
1. Document the feature purpose
2. Specify file location
3. List exported functions/types
4. Provide usage guidelines
5. Link to related features

### When Features Removed
1. Update or remove relevant documentation
2. Check for broken references
3. Update cross-references
4. Archive old documentation if needed
